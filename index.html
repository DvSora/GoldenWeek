            <div class="info-title">Showa Day</div>
            <div>昭和の日 - (Showa no Hi)</div>
            <p>Showa Day is a national holiday in Japan that encourages reflection on the Showa era, a time of dramatic transformation under Emperor Hirohito’s reign. The period saw Japan move from militarism and war to postwar recovery and economic growth. The name “Showa” combines the kanji for “shining” and “peace,” symbolizing the hope for enlightened harmony. Originally celebrated as the Emperor’s Birthday, the holiday evolved to honor the era itself. People observe it by attending public lectures, visiting historical sites, or simply spending time in nature, contemplating the lessons of the past and the resilience that shaped modern Japan.</p>

            <div>憲法記念日 - (Kenpō Kinenbi)</div>
            <p>Constitution Day in Japan invites quiet reflection on the nation's postwar transformation. It commemorates the enactment of the 1947 Constitution, which established democratic principles like popular sovereignty, pacifism, and respect for human rights. Unlike more festive holidays, this day is marked by subdued observances public lectures, editorial discussions, and open tours of government buildings like the National Diet. Many use the time to consider Japan’s role in the global community and the enduring impact of Article 9, which renounces war. Nestled within Golden Week, it’s also a moment for families to pause, reflect, and appreciate the freedoms they now enjoy</p>

            <div>みどりの日 - (Midori no Hi)</div>
            <p>Greenery Day in Japan celebrates the nation’s deep appreciation for nature and environmental harmony. Originally tied to Emperor Showa’s love of plants, it evolved into a standalone holiday that encourages people to reconnect with the natural world. Observances range from tree-planting ceremonies and nature walks to quiet moments in parks or gardens. Some cities host parades and decorate streets with lanterns, while others offer free admission to botanical gardens and zoos. It’s also a time to enjoy seasonal green tea and reflect on sustainable living. Nestled within Golden Week, Greenery Day blends celebration with contemplation of Earth’s quiet beauty.

            <p>Children’s Day in Japan celebrates the happiness, health, and individuality of children. Families raise colorful carp streamers called koinobori, symbolizing strength and perseverance. Homes are decorated with miniature samurai helmets and armor to inspire bravery. Traditional sweets like kashiwa-mochi (rice cakes wrapped in oak leaves) and chimaki (sweet rice dumplings) are enjoyed, while iris flowers are placed in baths to ward off evil. Though rooted in samurai-era customs for boys, the holiday now honors all children. It’s a joyful blend of folklore, seasonal beauty, and family bonding—an invitation to cherish the next generation and wish them a bright, resilient future
